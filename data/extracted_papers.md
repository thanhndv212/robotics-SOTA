**Key Contributions**:
- Fine manipulation tasks, such as threading cable ties or slotting a battery, are notoriously difficult for robots because they require precision, careful coordination of contact forces, and closed-loop visual feedback
- Performing these tasks typically requires high-end robots, accurate sensors, or careful calibration, which can be expensive and difficult to set up
- Can learning enable low-cost and imprecise hardware to perform these fine manipulation tasks? We present a low-cost system that performs end-to-end imitation learning directly from real demonstrations, collected with a custom teleoperation interface

**Methods**: To address these challenges, we develop a simple yet novel algorithm, Action Chunking with Transform...

**Key Contributions**:
- Identification of robot dynamics is a key issue in boosting the performance of model-based control techniques, having also a key role in realistic simulation
- Robot dynamic parameters have physical meaning, hence parameter estimations must correspond to physically feasible values
- Since it is only possible to identify linear combinations of parameters (the base parameters) the physical feasibility of such combinations cannot be directly asserted

**Authors**: Urrea C, Pascal J  
**Venue**: Comput. Electr. Eng.  
**Category**: Benchmarks and Evaluation

**Summary**: This study discusses the design and assessment of different parameter identification methods applied to robot systems, such as least squares, extended Kalman filter, Adaptive Linear Neuron (Adaline) n...

**Key Contributions**:
- First, the characteristics of the methods above mentioned are described
- Second, using the software MatLab/Simulink, a simulation of a Selective Compliant Assembly Robot Arm (SCARA) robot with 3 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) is carried out by applying these parameter identification methods, thereby obtaining the performance indicators of the algorithms that allow for parameter identification
- Experimental validation and results
